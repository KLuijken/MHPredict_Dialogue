For example, think of measuring the predictor 'bodyweight'. We can imagine all patients to have a true bodyweight $X$, and that we are measuring some value that might deviate upwards or downwards when using a scale to measure bodyweight: $W$. </p>\r\n      <div>However, for prediction purposes, it is hardly ever feasible (or even undesirable) to obtain error-free measurements in clinical practice. Hence, rather than defining 'true' and 'observed' values, we apply the measurement error models to define two measurement procedures of the same variable. For example, the predictor 'bodyweight' can be measured using a scale or by asking for self-reported weight. The connection between these procedures can be formally defined using measurement error models.  One could roughly say that we specified\r\n      <blockquote>\r\n      Measurement$_W$ = Measurement$_X$ + procedural variance,\r\n      </blockquote>\r\n      were Measurement$_W$ denotes the predictor measurement procedure with the highest variance and Measurement$_X$ denotes the predictor measurement procedure with the lowest variance. We use the terms <i>preferred</i> measurement for $X$ and <i>pragmatic</i> measurement for $W$. Either procedure can be applied in either derivation or validation setting.</div>\r\n      <B1 >\r\n            <div>More precisely,</div>\r\n            <exp>\r\n            <p> To distinguish different measurements of the same predictor, we denote an exact measurement of the predictor (e.g. bodyweight measured on a scale) by $X$ and a pragmatic measurement (e.g. self-reported weight) by $W$. The connection between $X$ and $W$ can be formally defined using measurement error models (<a href=\"#Keogh2014\">Keogh et al., 2014</a>). Assuming that the relation between $X$ and $W$ is linear and additive, the association between $W$ and $X$ can be described as\r\n <p>{\"$$E(W | Y = y) = \\\\psi_{Y = y} + \\\\theta_{Y = y}E(X)  + \\\\epsilon_{Y = y},$$\"}</p>\r\n<p>{\"$$Var(W | Y = y) = \\\\theta_{Y = y}^2\\\\sigma_X^2  + \\\\sigma_{\\\\epsilon_{Y = y}}^2,$$\"}</p>\r\nwhere $\\epsilon$$_Y$<small>=</small>$_y$ ~ N(0,$\\sigma$$_\\epsilon$$^2$) and all parameters may depend on the value of $Y$, indicating that measurements can differ between individuals in which the outcome is observed (cases) and individuals in which the outcome is not observed (non-cases). The parameter $\\psi$ reflects the mean difference between $X$ and $W | Y$ = $y$, $\\theta$ indicates the linear association between measurement $W | Y$ = $y$ and $X$, and $\\sigma$$_\\epsilon$$^2$ reflects variance introduced by random deviations in the measurement process, where a larger $\\sigma$$_\\epsilon$$^2$ indicates that the measurement $W$ is less precise.\r\n      </p>\r\n              <small>\r\n                <B1 >\r\n                  <div>So,</div>\r\n                  <exp>The term <i>measurement error</i> applies to situations where both an exact measurement and a pragmatic measurement of a predictor are available within a setting (e.g., the derivation set), and thus where the parameters $\\psi$, $\\theta$ and $\\sigma$$_\\epsilon$$^2$ define the degree of measurement error in $W$ with respect to $X$. The term <i>measurement heterogeneity</i> refers to situations where the same predictor is measured heterogeneously across settings of derivation and validation. The most precise measurement (whether available at derivation or validation) corresponds to $X$ and the parameters $\\psi$, $\\theta$ and $\\sigma$$_\\epsilon$$^2$ define the degree of heterogeneity between $X$ and $W$.</exp>\r\n                </B1>\r\n              </small>\r\n            </exp>\r\n          </B1>\r\n   </B1>\r\n   \r\n<B2 user=\"\">Nice framework. Before you present your results, can you give an example of predictor measurement heterogeneity?</B2>\r\n    <B1 >\r\n      <p>Let's consider the measurement of bodyweight. A research protocol could specify that bodyweight should be obtained using a scale (and perhaps other conditions, such as standarized subject position and -clothing). However, in clinical practice, a self-reported measure of bodyweight may be obtained. When a prediction model containing the predictor 'bodyweight' is derived based on the standardized instrumental measure and validated using the self-reported measure, or vice versa, we say that this predictor is measured heterogeneously across settings.</p>\r\n      <exp> Another example would be the measurement of blood pressure values. A research protocol could specify that blood pressure values should be obtained by averaging three blood pressure measurements that are taken under standardized conditions. However, in clinical practice, blood pressure is often measured a single time under non-standard conditions.\r\n      </exp>\r\n    </B1>\r\n\r\n       <B1 id=\"Measurement heterogeneity-I\" className=\"result\" >\r\n      <div className=\"panel-heading\">\r\n        <h3 className=\"bubble-title\">I.

In logistic regression, calibration can be determined using a re-calibration model, where the observed outcomes in validation data, $y_V$, are regressed on a linear predictor (lp). This linear predictor is obtained by combining the regression coefficients estimated from the derivation data, $\\alpha_D$ and $\\beta_D$, with the predictor values in the validation data, $x_V$. The recalibration model is defined as\r\n           <p>{\"$$\\\\text{logit}(y_V) = a + b\\\\times\\\\text{lp},$$\"}</p>\r\nwhere $lp = \\alpha_D + \\beta_Dx_V$ and $b$ represents the calibration slope. A calibration slope $b = 1$ indicates  perfect calibration. A calibration slope b less than $1$ indicates that predicted probabilities are too extreme compared to observed probabilities, which is often found in situations of 'statistical overfitting'. A calibration slope b greater than $1$ indicates that the provided predicted probabilities are too close to the outcome incidence, also referred to as 'statistical underfitting'. Additional to the calibration slope, we evaluated the difference between the average observed event rate and the mean predicted event rate (i.e. calibration-in-the-large, which can be computed as the intercept of the recalibration model while using an offset for the linear predictor, i.e., $a | b = 1$ ).

Here, data from IOTA phases I to III are used. \r\n          </exp>\r\n        </B1>\r\n        <B1 >\r\n          <div>What was the prediction model?</div>\r\n          <exp>\r\n            We evaluated a logistic regression model that estimates the probability of presence of ovarian mass malignancy from pre-operatively measuredpredictors: age (in years); maximal diameter of the tumor (in mm); personal history of ovarian cancer (yes/no); current use of hormonal therapy (yes/no); experience of pain during examination (yes/no); presence of ascites (yes/no); presence of blood flow within a solid papillary projection (yes/no); maximal diameter of the largest solid component (in mm); presence  of  irregular  cyst  walls (yes/no); presence  of  acoustic  shadows (yes/no); color  score  of intratumoral blood flow (ordinal, ranging 1-4); and presence of entirely solid tumors (yes/no). It was developed and internally validated in IOTA phase I data and has been externally validated several times. \r\n          </exp>\r\n        </B1>\r\n        <B1 >\r\n          <div>How was the predictor measurement heterogeneity defined?</div>\r\n          <exp>\r\n            We defined predictor measurement heterogeneity for various predictors in the model. Here, we discuss the predictor 'Diameter of the solid component of the ovarian tumor' (in mm). This predictor was measured according to two strategies: (i) the diameter was truncated at 50mm or (ii) the original value of the diameter was used. We refer to the truncated diameter as the <i>preferred</i> measurement, and to the non-truncated diameter as the <i>pragmatic</i> measurement. The truncated diameter is preferred because this was found to be the most informative predictor in previous studies in the IOTA data.\r\n            <B2>Why would anyone use a measure of the diameter different from the one the model was derived from? </B2><exp> \r\n            This could be motivated by various reasons. For one, the model could be implied in a clinical setting where a physician is unaware that the values should be truncated. Additionally, a dataset may simply not contain the particular measurement. When this dataset is readily available, researchers may want to use it for model validation despite the measurement heterogeneity.</exp>\r\n            \r\n          </exp>\r\n        </B1>\r\n    </B1>\r\n <B1 className=\"result\">\r\n    <div className=\"panel-heading\">\r\n        <h3 className=\"bubble-title\">Results empirical example</h3>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div>When the preferred predictor measurement (truncated diameter) was substituted by the pragmatic predictor measurement (non-truncated diameter), the predictive performance measures at validation were as follows:</div>\r\n      <p>Calibration-in-the-large coefficient: -0.44 (-0.50; -0.37), indicating systematic overestimation of the predicted risks.</p>\r\n      <p>Calibration slope: 0.71 (0.65; 0.75),  indicating  that predicted riskswere too extremecompared to the observed proportions.</p>\r\n      <p> The c-statistic and scaled Brier score changed minimally, by -0.009 (-0.010;-0.007) and\t-0.02 (-0.03; -0.02), respectively. <small>(Note that we have scaled the Brier score here by its maximum score.)</small></p>\r\n      <exp>\r\n      <div>When the preferred predictor measurement (truncated diameter) was substituted by the pragmatic predictor measurement (non-truncated diameter), the predictive performance measures at validation were as follows:</div> \r\n      <p>Calibration-in-the-large coefficient: 0.22 (0.11; 0.32), indicating systematic underestimation of the predicted risks.</p>\r\n      <p>Calibration slope: 1.08 (1.03; 1.14), indicating that predicted risks were too close to the overall event rate compared to observed proportions.</p>\r\n      <p> The c-statistic and Brier score changed minimally, by 0.0002 (-0.0007; 0.0010) and -0.02 (-0.02; -0.01), respectively.</p>\r\n      <B1 >\r\n            <div>Over all 9 scenarios, </div>\r\n      <exp>\r\n      <p>the predictive performance at validation was quite different from performance at derivation, mainly in terms of calibration. The calibration intercept at validation ranged from -0.70 to 1.43, while the calibration slope ranged from 0.50 to 1.67. The difference in c-statistic and scaled Brier score between derivation and validation ranged from -0.08 to +0.08 and from -0.40 to +0.16, respectively.</p>\r\n      </exp>\r\n      </B1>\r\n      </exp>\r\n    </B1>\r\n    <B2  user=\"\">\r\n      <p>Ok, that seems to be quite impactful for the validity and reliability of predictions at validation. How can I correct for predictor measurement heterogeneity?</p>\r\n    </B2>\r\n    <B1>\r\n      <div>To be honest, although correction for measurement error is possible in theory, we expect that the applicability of these methods to correct for measurement heterogeneity in prediction studies will be limited. This is not only due to the fact that individual patient data of both the derivation and validation set are required, but furthermore because it is infeasible to disentangle measurement parameters from other characteristics of the data. The main contribution of the taxonomy of measurement error models rises from its aptitude to conceptualize measurement heterogeneity across settings in pragmatic terms.</div>      <exp>\r\n      <p>Additional to measurement correction methods, one could think about methods that address the miscalibration of the model. For example, it is recommended to apply shrinkage methods to prevent model overfitting. We think about measurement heterogeneity as a separate issue. Under different scenarios of measurement heterogeneity, shrinkage could both improve and diminish the calibration of the model at validation. Rather than correcting for measurement heterogeneity in a statistical way, measurement procedures should be considered in the design phase of as study (i.e., at data collection).</p>\r\n      <p>Note that this does NOT imply we recommend against shrinkage, but the motivation to apply it should come from modelling considerations rather than data characteristics.</p>\r\n      </exp>\r\n    </B1>\r\n<B2 user={<a href=\"#Steyerberg2018\">Steyerberg et al (2018)</a>}>\r\n      <div>Don't forget about modelling issues.</div>\r\n</B2>    \r\n<B1>Absolutely, all recommendations are additional to modelling strategies and sample size considerations.</B1>\r\n    <B2>What do you recommend for epidemiologic prediction studies?</B2>\r\n<B1 id=\"Recommendations\" className=\"result\" >\r\n      <div className=\"panel-heading\">\r\n        <h3 className=\"bubble-title\">Recommendations</h3>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>The following implications follow from our work:</p>\r\n      <p>Ideally, prediction models are derived using predictor measurements that resemble measurement procedures in the intended setting of application. A mismatch is likely to result in miscalibration of the model.</p>\r\n      <p>Researchers should bear in mind the implications of using a 'readily available dataset' for model derivation or validation as data quality directly affects estimates of predictive performance of the model.</p>\r\n      <p>Descriptions of measurement procedures at model derivation are essential for proper external validation of the model. Likewise, validation studies ideally contain descriptions of deviations from measurements used at derivation, as these may introduce discrepancies in predictive performance. And finally, clear descriptions of measurement procedures provide guidance for clinicians on how to implement a prediction model in a clinical setting.</p>\r\n      </B1>\r\n<B2 user={<a href=\"#Collins2015\">Collins et al (2015)</a>}>\r\n      <div>Actually, you quantified <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tripod-statement.org/TRIPOD/TRIPOD-Checklists/TRIPOD-Checklist-Prediction-Model-Development-and-Validation\">item 7</a> in our TRIPOD checklist.\r\n      </div>\r\n</B2>\r\n<B2 user={<a href=\"#Wynants2013\">Wynants et al (2013)</a>}>\r\n      <div>In case of multicenter prediction studies, it might also be wise to quantify the measurement variability <i>within</i> the overall study dataset.

Great to go over these implications of differences in predictor measurement procedures. A prediction model really isn't only about the algorithm relating predictors to the outcome, but also depends on the procedures by which model input is measured, i.e. qualitative differences in data collection.</B1>\r\n<B1><p>We hope this info shed a different light on the importance of measurement in prediction research. We highlight heterogeneity in predictor measurement procedures <i>across</i> settings as an important driver of unanticipated predictive performance at external validation. Preventing measurement heterogeneity at the design phase of a prediction study, both in development and validation studies, facilitates interpretation of predictive performance and benefits the transportability of the prediction model.</p>\r\n</B1>\r\n<B1>\r\n<p>Interested in learning more about this topic?</p>\r\n<p>We refer to:</p>\r\n<p> This <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8183\">paper</a> for the simulation studies, with a shiny app <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://kluijken.shinyapps.io/MH_Predict_Examples/\">here</a> to explore the results further.</p>\r\n<p> This <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://osf.io/xmdtr/\">paper</a> for the empirical studies. </p>\r\n<p> Please contact k.luijken@lumc.nl if you have any questions or suggestions.</p>\r\n</B1>\r\n\r\n\r\n    {/*refs*/}\r\n    <B2 style={{\"fontSize\":\"0.8em\"}}>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <b>\r\n        References:\r\n        </b>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n      <a id=\"Luijken2019a\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8183\" target=\"_blank\">Luijken et al (2019a).
